# Copy & Paste Guides

For those who rather use guides instead of the layout option in Sketch it's often frustrating to change guides for multiple artboards, especially when working with larger documents.
That's why we've created a plugin to easily copy, paste and remove guides from your Sketch artboard(s).

## Installation
To install the plugin you should perform the following actions;
- 1. Download the .zip file and copy 'Copy & Paste Guides.sketchplugin'
- 2. Open Sketch and navigate to 'Plugins > Manage Plugins > [cog symbol] > Show plugins folder
- 3. Paste the 'Copy & Paste Guides.sketchplugin' into the plugins folder

Once you're done, you can now use the plugin!

### Remove guides
